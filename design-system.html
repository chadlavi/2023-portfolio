          <p>
            Objective: take a design system for a startup that makes case
            management software for social workers and grow it to scale with us
            as we added more functionality and flexibility to our product.
          </p>
          <h2>Getting the team on the same page</h2>
          <p>
            Before I joined the team, there were no shared design assets beyond
            a few neglected sketch files in Google Drive. Designers were
            starting from scratch each time they started a new design file,
            wasting time and introducing a lot of small inconsistencies between
            designs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem: there were no shared design assets beyond a few
            neglected sketch files in Google Drive. Designers were starting from
            scratch each time they started a new design file, wasting time and
            introducing a lot of small inconsistencies between designs.
          </p>
          <h3>Moving from Sketch to Figma</h3>
          <p>
            I made a case to senior leadership to move our design team from
            Sketch to Figma, enabling us to work faster and share library
            resources. Figma was relatively new at the time (2018) so I trained
            the other designers on it.
          </p>
          <p>Figma offered some key features we needed:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              we could create sharable interactive prototypes without using
              other apps
            </li>
            <li>we could share library assets between design files</li>
            <li>
              product managers and developers could comment on our design files
              and access the most up to date designs in real time
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The move to Figma allowed us to eliminate a few other subscriptions
            like InVision and Zeppelin and made our design process more
            repeatable.
          </p>
          <h3>Building out the initial component library</h3>
          <p>
            After getting everyone working in Figma, I built out and published
            an initial component library file, incorporating the text styles,
            colors, and components we already had. I worked with the other
            designers on retrofitting these new components into their existing
            design files to get them consistent and up to date.
          </p>
          <h3>Establishing our process</h3>
          <p>
            With an initial library in place, I led the team in establishing the
            design system processes and governance that are still used today.
          </p>
          <h4>Identifying new components</h4>
          <p>
            We started by identifying emerging patterns in new design work,
            reducing duplicate design effort and increasing consistency.
          </p>
          <p>
            The process I established for adding a new pattern to the DS was:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Move it into the DS library file</li>
            <li>Use the library colors and text styles</li>
            <li>
              Add any necessary variants (hover states, disabled versions, empty
              states)
            </li>
            <li>Name it consistently</li>
            <li>Publish a new version of the Figma library</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Channels and rituals for communication</h3>
          <p>
            Throughout this process of standardization, I facilitated
            communication between designers and developers by ensuring each team
            was using the same names for colors, text variants, and components.
            Moving forward, I needed to make sure everyone had ways of
            contributing and keeping up to date on the latest changes.
          </p>
          <h4>Meetings</h4>
          <p>
            In addition to our weekly design critique sessions, I implemented a
            weekly meeting to review possible design patterns.
          </p>
          <p>
            To breakdown siloes in the organization, I instituted monthly Design
            System open houses, where I gave a brief DS update and anyone in the
            company could ask questions. I was pleased to find that people from
            our sales team were regular attendees. These DS open house sessions
            were a chance for them to get an inside look at our design process,
            and share feedback and new user needs they were hearing in sales
            calls.
          </p>
          <h4>Asynchronous communication</h4>
          <p>
            I created a <code>#design-system</code> channel in our company
            Slack. I posted about updates in our design system in that channel
            and encouraged anyone with questions to ask it in that channel, so
            that both the question and the answer could be available in a shared
            space.
          </p>
          <h4>User testing</h4>
          <p>
            Casebook's users, social workers, are a specialized group, with
            unique challenges: while not especially technical, they must process
            very detailed information about their clients and the services they
            provide, and must follow very rigorous documentation and process
            standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            I incorporated questions about our design system components into our
            regular and recurring user research sessions to help us make
            Casebook intuitive and easy to use for our target user base.
          </p>
          <h2>Improving documentation</h2>
          <p>
            The existing documentation page was limited, difficult to navigate,
            and hard to maintain.
          </p>
          <p>
            I replaced it with an interactive Storybook docs app, so that
            designers, product managers and developers could browse our
            components and learn how to use them. Moving to Storybook also
            enabled me to provide documentation for designers and developers in
            a single place.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can see the live documentation site I created here:
            <a
              href="https://casecommons.github.io/cbp-undercase-lib/"
              target="_blank"
              >https://casecommons.github.io/cbp-undercase-lib/</a
            >
          </p>
          <h2>Adding flexibility to future-proof our design components</h2>
          <p>
            As we tackled more complex problems in our product, we needed our
            design system to become more flexible and expressive over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the design side, this was somewhat easy; as long as we used our
            standard set of colors, typefaces, spacing units and shadows (our
            design tokens), a design would work within our system.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the developer side, building those designs without writing custom
            CSS would require creating a large set of cumbersome,
            manually-maintained style options on every component, which isn't
            very DRY. To make this more maintainable and extensible, I built a
            generalized way of allowing our developers to specify design tokens
            on a black box component.
          </p>
          <p>
            This approach allowed our developers to build any design that
            adhered to our design system, simply by specifying style attributes
            that looked like CSS-in-JS.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had previous experience working with the
            <a href="https://emotion.sh" target="_blank">Emotion style system</a
            >, and based the general pattern on their
            <code>@emotion/styled</code> library.
          </p>
          <h2>Impact</h2>
          <p>
            In growing our design system at Casebook, my goal was to add
            flexibility, consistency and expressiveness. I achieved this by
            moving the design team to Figma so we could work more efficiently
            and share design assets, creating and maintaining a set of shared
            design assets, ensuring our shared design components were working
            well for our users, and building flexibility into our shared
            components so they can rise to the challenge of future design needs.
