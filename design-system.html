      <p>
        Objective: take a design system for a startup that makes case management
        software for social workers and grow it to scale with us as we added
        more functionality and flexibility to our product.
      </p>
      <h2>Getting the team on the same page</h2>
      <p>
        Before I joined the team, there were no shared design assets beyond a
        few neglected sketch files in Google Drive. Designers were starting from
        scratch each time they started a new design file, wasting time and
        introducing a lot of small inconsistencies between designs.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img alt="" srcset="./images/ds/before-ds.png" />
        <figcaption>

          Casebook. Are these the right styles and colors? The designer has to
          just remember!
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Moving from Sketch to Figma</h3>
      <p>
        I made a case to senior leadership to move our design team from Sketch
        to Figma, enabling us to work faster and share library resources. Figma
        was relatively new at the time (2018) so I trained the other designers
        on it.
      </p>
      <p>Figma offered some key features we needed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          we could create sharable interactive prototypes without using other
          apps
        </li>
        <li>we could share library assets between design files</li>
        <li>
          product managers and developers could comment on our design files and
          access the most up to date designs in real time
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The move to Figma allowed us to eliminate a few other subscriptions like
        InVision and Zeppelin and made our design process more repeatable.
      </p>
      <h3>Building out the initial component library</h3>
      <p>
        After getting everyone working in Figma, I built out and published an
        initial component library file, incorporating the text styles, colors,
        and components we already had. I worked with the other designers on
        retrofitting these new components into their existing design files to
        get them consistent and up to date.
      </p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Establishing our process</h3>
      <p>
        With an initial library in place, I led the team in establishing the
        design system processes and governance that are still used today.
      </p>

        />

      <h4>Identifying new components</h4>
      <p>
        We started by identifying emerging patterns in new design work, reducing
        duplicate design effort and increasing consistency.
      </p>
      <p>The process I established for adding a new pattern to the DS was:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Move it into the DS library file</li>
        <li>Use the library colors and text styles</li>
        <li>
          Add any necessary variants (hover states, disabled versions, empty
          states)
        </li>
        <li>Name it consistently</li>
        <li>Publish a new version of the Figma library</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Channels and rituals for communication</h3>
      <p>
        Throughout this process of standardization, I facilitated communication
        between designers and developers by ensuring each team was using the
        same names for colors, text variants, and components. Moving forward, I
        needed to make sure everyone had ways of contributing and keeping up to
        date on the latest changes.
      </p>
      <h4>Meetings</h4>
      <p>
        In addition to our weekly design critique sessions, I implemented a
        weekly meeting to review possible design patterns.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="./images/ds/monthy-ds-meeting.png" />
        <figcaption>
          I held monthly org-wide open houses to discuss DS usage and issues
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        To breakdown siloes in the organization, I instituted monthly Design
        System open houses, where I gave a brief DS update and anyone in the
        company could ask questions. I was pleased to find that people from our
        sales team were regular attendees. These DS open house sessions were a
        chance for them to get an inside look at our design process, and share
        feedback and new user needs they were hearing in sales calls.
      </p>

      <h4>Asynchronous communication</h4>
      <p>
        I created a <code>#design-system</code> channel in our company Slack. I
        posted about updates in our design system in that channel and encouraged
        anyone with questions to ask it in that channel, so that both the
        question and the answer could be available in a shared space.
      </p>
      <h4>User testing</h4>
      <p>
        Casebook's users, social workers, are a specialized group, with unique
        challenges: while not especially technical, they must process very
        detailed information about their clients and the services they provide,
        and must follow very rigorous documentation and process standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        When new components were added for new design work, I made sure
        questions geared to assess their efficacy were included in the user
        research sessions for that design work, to make sure the patterns we
        were adding and spreading within our app were intuitive and worked well.
      </p>
      <h2>Improving documentation</h2>
      <p>
        The existing documentation page was limited, difficult to navigate, and
        hard to maintain.
      </p>
      <p>
        I replaced it with an interactive Storybook docs app, so that designers,
        product managers and developers could browse our components and learn
        how to use them. Moving to Storybook also enabled me to provide
        documentation for designers and developers in a single place.
      </p>

      <h2>Adding flexibility to future-proof our design components</h2>
      <p>
        As we tackled more complex problems in our product, we needed our design
        system to become more flexible and expressive over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the design side, this was somewhat easy; as long as we used our
        standard set of colors, typefaces, spacing units and shadows (our design
        tokens), a design would work within our system.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the developer side, building those designs without writing custom CSS
        would require creating a large set of cumbersome, manually-maintained
        style options on every component, which isn't very DRY. To make this
        more maintainable and extensible, I built a generalized way of allowing
        our developers to specify design tokens on a black box component.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="./images/ds/calendar-event.png" />
        <figcaption>
          The <code>Layout</code> component made it easy to compose complex
          components like this calendar event
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        This approach allowed our developers to build any design that adhered to
        our design system, simply by specifying style attributes that looked
        like CSS-in-JS.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had previous experience working with the
        <a href="https://emotion.sh" target="_blank">Emotion style system</a>,
        and based the general pattern on their
        <code>@emotion/styled</code> library.
      </p>
      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <p>
        In growing our design system at Casebook, my goal was to add
        flexibility, consistency and expressiveness. I achieved this by moving
        the design team to Figma so we could work more efficiently and share
        design assets, creating and maintaining a set of shared design assets,
        ensuring our shared design components were working well for our users,
        and building flexibility into our shared components so they can rise to
        the challenge of future design needs.
