        Bringing co-founders' vision to life by iterating on an MVP
      </h1>
      <p>
        Arazoo was a SaaS platform for the architecture and interior design
        industry that I worked on from 2014 to 2018. The founders of Arazoo were
        non-technical &mdash; a lawyer and an architect who had run a successful
        NYC construction project management firm for several decades &mdash; and
        they started with a minimal MVP made by a contractor.
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>
        Once they had their demo-able MVP, I was hired to help bring their
        vision to life.
      </p>
      <p>
        My first step was to accompany the co-founders on demo visits to
        architecture and design firms in NYC and listened in on sales calls,
        noting feedback and questions about the MVP product. I also visited the
        offices of our most active champion users and watched them use the
        product.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned that several aspects of our users' process were not supported
        in Arazoo, and they had developed clunky, sometimes elaborate
        workarounds to collaborate with their colleagues and clients. Based on
        that, I focused on increasing collaboration and reducing friction.
      </p>
      <p>
        To fulfill the founders' vision, I also needed to set up the platform up
        for e-commerce.
      </p>
      <h2>Increasing Collaboration</h2>
      <p>
        The basic use case of Arazoo centered around the building materials and
        finishes research and specification process. In the MVP, users could use
        our web clipper tool to save building material details from manufacturer
        websites and create specification documents for handoff to contractors.
        I discovered that users were emailing their colleagues and contractors
        with notes and comments about building materials, then copying and
        pasting those emails into their building materials' descriptions for
        lack of a better place to store that information. They were also
        reluctant to use Arazoo for their full specification process, because
        there was no "final approval" feature.
      </p>
      <h3>Comments</h3>
      <p>
        One of the first collaboration features I added to Arazoo was the
        ability to carry on a conversation within Arazoo about a specific
        building material. This enabled users to capture the conversations they
        would have otherwise had out of system about technical information,
        vendor contact details or configuration options. Arazoo users on the
        same team could now comment back and forth on a building material and
        @-mention each other to send email alerts about time-sensitive comments.
      </p>

        />

      </figure>
      <h3>Sharing</h3>
      <p>
        To address users' need to collaborate with outside parties like clients
        and contractors, I added the ability to share a secure link to building
        materials in their libraries and projects. Users could set their own
        privacy levels for what information was shared with outside parties and
        allow share recipients to add comments.
      </p>

        <img class="zoomable" alt="" srcset="./images/arazoo/share-modal.png" />
        <figcaption>Sharing feature</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Product and material statuses</h3>
      <p>
        The architectural specification process often includes several rounds of
        proposals and revisions, culminating in final approval by both clients
        and project leadership. I created a flexible status system that enabled
        users to track this process, capture final approval or give specific
        users elevated permissions within a project.
      </p>

      </figure>
      <h2>Reducing friction</h2>
      <h3>Crowd-sourcing building material information</h3>
      <p>
        One of the first things we implemented was a crowd-sourced global
        library accessible to all Arazoo users. Whenever a user used our web
        clipper tool to save a building material into Arazoo, they had the
        option to add it to the global Arazoo library. This made the building
        material discoverable for all Arazoo users, building up a library of
        browsable content that meant Arazoo could be not just a place to store
        information, but a place to discover new building materials.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img
          class="zoomable"
          alt=""
          srcset="./images/arazoo/global-library.png"
        />
        <figcaption>
          Arazoo's global library contained crowd-sourced building material
          information
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Mobile</h3>
      <p>
        The MVP of Arazoo was designed as a desktop app, and did not perform
        well on small screens or touchscreen devices. I found that users
        frequently needed to access their building material data in the field,
        usually on their phone or tablet. Many of our early power users had
        workarounds for accessing their Arazoo data in the field -- some even
        printed out their Arazoo building material information and carried it
        with them for site visits, annotating it by hand, then updating as
        necessary when they got back to their desks.
      </p>
      <p>
        By auditing our web app, I created a list to optimize for mobile and
        address each problem in priority order.
      </p>
      <h4>Navigation</h4>
      <p>
        The desktop version of Arazoo had a breadcrumb-based navigation that
        wouldn't work on mobile, and used a tabbed navigational model within
        projects to access different parts of projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I redesigned the navigation as a menu overlay that let users access
        their favorite building materials, their team's libraries and projects,
        and quickly browse top-level categories in the global Arazoo library.
      </p>

        />
        <figcaption>Mobile nav</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h4>Building material details</h4>
      <p>
        Arazoo's building material detail view was a partial screen overlay that
        moved in from the right and had scrollable content.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img
          class="zoomable"

        <figcaption>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h2>Building to an e-commerce experience</h2>
      <p>
        I was given a strong mandate from the founders to create experiences
        that could support a future transition to e-commerce in Arazoo. The
        founders' vision was that Arazoo should be a one-stop shop for finding,
        specifying, and purchasing building materials.
      </p>
      <p>
        The crowd-sourcing feature was the first step in this process, quickly
        followed by the addition of ratings, verified building materials, and
        sponsored ads.

      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <p>
        Arazoo was acquired by a large building materials manufacturer in 2018.
        At the time Arazoo was acquired, the platform had thousands of users at
        top architecture and design firms in the US and Canada, as well as
        thousands of individual free-tier users.
