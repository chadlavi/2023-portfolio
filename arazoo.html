            Bringing co-founders' vision to life by iterating on an MVP
          </h1>
          <p>
            Arazoo was a SaaS platform for the architecture and interior design
            industry that I worked on from 2014 to 2018. The founders of Arazoo
            were non-technical &mdash; a lawyer and an architect who had run a
            successful NYC construction project management firm for several
            decades &mdash; and they started with a minimal MVP made by a
            contractor. Once they had their demo-able MVP, I was hired to help
            bring their vision to life.
          </p>
          <p>
            My first step was to accompany the co-founders on demo visits to
            architecture and design firms in NYC and listened in on sales calls,
            noting feedback and questions about the MVP product. I also visited
            the offices of our most active champion users and watched them use
            the product.
          </p>
          <p>
            I learned that several aspects of our users' process were not
            supported in Arazoo, and they had developed clunky, sometimes
            elaborate workarounds to collaborate with their colleagues and
            clients. Based on that, I focused on increasing collaboration and
            reducing friction.
          </p>
          <p>
            To fulfill the founders' vision, I also needed to set up the
            platform up for e-commerce.
          </p>
          <h2>Increasing Collaboration</h2>
          <p>
            The basic use case of Arazoo centered around the building materials
            and finishes research and specification process. In the MVP, users
            could use our web clipper tool to save building material details
            from manufacturer websites and create specification documents for
            handoff to contractors. I discovered that users were emailing their
            colleagues and contractors with notes and comments about building
            materials, then copying and pasting those emails into their building
            materials' descriptions for lack of a better place to store that
            information. They were also reluctant to use Arazoo for their full
            specification process, because there was no "final approval"
            feature.
          </p>
          <h3>Notes feature</h3>
          <p>
            The first collaboration feature we implemented was Notes. Arazoo
            users on the same team could add shared notes to any building
            material. These included anything from technical information to
            vendor contact details or configuration options.
          </p>
          <h3>Comments</h3>
          <p>
            I added the ability to carry on a conversation within Arazoo about a
            specific building material, to capture the conversations users would
            have otherwise emailed out of system. Arazoo users on the same team
            could now comment back and forth on a building material and
            @-mention each other to send email alerts about time-sensitive
            comments.
          </p>
          <h3>Sharing</h3>
          <p>
            To address users' need to collaborate with outside parties like
            clients and contractors, I added the ability to share a secure link
            to building materials in their libraries and projects. Users could
            set their own privacy levels for what information was shared with
            outside parties and allow share recipients to add comments.
          </p>
          <h3>Permissions and approval flows</h3>
          <p>
            The architectural specification process often includes several
            rounds of proposals and revisions, culminating in final approval by
            both clients and project leadership. I created features that enabled
            users to track this process, capture final approval or give specific
            users elevated permissions within a project.
          </p>

          <h2>Reducing friction</h2>
          <h3>Crowd-sourcing building material information</h3>
          <p>
            One of the first things we implemented was a crowd-sourced global
            library accessible to all Arazoo users. Whenever a user used our web
            clipper tool to save a building material into Arazoo, they had the
            option to add it to the global Arazoo library. This made the
            building material discoverable for all Arazoo users, building up a
            library of browsable content that meant Arazoo could be not just a
            place to store information, but a place to discover new building
            materials.
          </p>
          <h3>Mobile</h3>
          <p>
            The MVP of Arazoo was designed as a desktop app, and did not perform
            well on small screens or touchscreen devices. I found that users
            frequently needed to access their building material data in the
            field, usually on their phone or tablet. Many of our early power
            users had workarounds for accessing their Arazoo data in the field
            -- some even printed out their Arazoo building material information
            and carried it with them for site visits, annotating it by hand,
            then updating as necessary when they got back to their desks.
          </p>
          <p>
            By auditing our web app, I created a list to optimize for mobile and
            address each problem in priority order.
          </p>
          <h4>Navigation</h4>
          <p>
            The desktop version of Arazoo had a breadcrumb-based navigation that
            wouldn't work on mobile, and used a tabbed navigational model within
            projects to access different parts of projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            I redesigned the navigation as a menu overlay that let users access
            their favorite building materials, their team's libraries and
            projects, and quickly browse top-level categories in the global
            Arazoo library.
          </p>

          <h4>Building material details</h4>
          <p>
            Arazoo's building material detail view was a partial screen overlay
            that moved in from the right and had scrollable content.
          </p>

          <p>For mobile, I redesigned this to be a full-screen experience.</p>

          <h2>Building to an e-commerce experience</h2>
          <p>
            I was given a strong mandate from the founders to create experiences
            that could support a future transition to e-commerce in Arazoo. The
            founders' vision was that Arazoo should be a one-stop shop for
            finding, specifying, and purchasing building materials.
          </p>
          <p>
            The crowd-sourcing feature was the first step in this process,
            quickly followed by the addition of ratings, verified building
            materials, and sponsored ads.
