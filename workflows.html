        Building an automation engine for social work
      </h1>
      <p>
        Social workers usually have too many cases and not enough time; but they
        also have rigid documentation requirements, which means they spend hours
        of their own time after work getting caught up on paperwork and manually
        tracking their clients' progress. This can lead to burn-out (as an
        industry, social workers have a very high turnover rate) and mistakes.
        In social work, a client's life is literally on the line, and one
        paperwork mistake made by a tired, overworked social worker can have
        serious negative consequences.
      </p>

      <p>
        At Casebook, a startup that makes integrated case management software
        for social workers, my team identified a significant opportunity to
        improve the workflow of social workers by building an automation engine
        in Casebook that reduces complexity and repetitive work, and increases
        procedural consistency.
      </p>
      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>
        Over the summer of 2020, the lead product manager and I conducted
        several interviews with users and joined new customer onboarding calls
        to learn about our users' repeatable processes.
      </p>

        />
        <figcaption>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        All the folks we spoke with could clearly describe at least 3-5
        high-level processes that are well-defined within their practice and
        common to most of their cases.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>most of these processes are tracked on paper, if at all</li>
        <li>
          almost all of these processes may need to be ended early or abandoned
        </li>
        <li>Some steps in these processes are required, some are optional</li>
        <li>
          there are always exceptions! sometimes a supervisor needs to be able
          to skip required parts of a process or add in new ones
        </li>
        <li>
          some processes (and some steps within those processes) have hard
          deadlines that need to be tracked
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The vast number of steps, possible changes, contingencies and the need
        to document it all leads to inconsistencies, errors, and social worker
        burnout. Our customers needed a way to keep track of all of this in a
        systematic way.
      </p>
      <h2>Making complex things simple</h2>
      <p>
        The feature we built in response to this need allowed admin users to
        model real-world repeatable processes in Casebook with task lists and
        create event-based triggers to automatically initiate them.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, an administrator at an agency that helps unhoused minors
        who have experienced human trafficking could create a safety assessment
        checklist that starts automatically for every new client, or an
        "independent living transition" workflow for kids who age out of the
        system, which would start automatically based on the client's age.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img alt="" srcset="./images/workflows/safety-assessment.png 2x" />
        <figcaption>A custom safety assessment workflow in Casebook</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        This enables social workers to centralize their work. Each case or
        client record has a list of all the actions that need to be taken next,
        and the social worker can see the list of all their tasks across cases
        on their home dashboard. What was previously a stack of paper files,
        several different spreadsheets, and sometimes post-it notes on a social
        worker's desk is now a clear set of digitized, prioritized tasks.
      </p>
      <h2>Reducing repetitive work</h2>
      <p>
        To reduce repetitive documentation work, I designed tasks in Casebook to
        be action-oriented. Tasks that require filling out forms or uploading
        files automatically mark themselves complete when those actions are
        taken. This means social workers do not need to spend extra time
        documenting that they completed a paper form or received a document from
        a client; the task marks itself complete when the social worker enters
        that data into Casebook.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img alt="" srcset="./images/workflows/task-design.png 2x" />
        <figcaption>

          filling out forms or uploading files
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h2>Increasing consistency and accuracy</h2>
      <p>
        As the social worker no longer needs to remember which steps to take on
        each case, they are prompted to complete the same steps for the same
        situation each time it arises. This leads to a higher standard of care
        for clients.
      </p>
      <p>
        Centrally administered settings for automation flows also means that
        changes in an organization's processes can be implemented right away,
        without relying on social workers to remember new steps or changes to
        existing steps.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img alt="" srcset="./images/workflows/workflow-admin-panel.png 2x" />
        <figcaption>

          and update them in one place
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Adding automated workflows to Casebook also increased transparency for
        supervisors. Instead of waiting for a check-in meeting or asking the
        social worker to set aside time to write up a progress report,
        supervisors can see the current state of all of their workers' cases in
        real time.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img alt="" srcset="./images/workflows/tasks-on-dashboard.png 2x" />
        <figcaption>
          Users and their supervisors can see upcoming tasks across all their
          cases on the home dashboard
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h2>Growing the feature</h2>
      <p>
        Automated workflows were initially added to case management in Casebook,
        but have since been extended to Casebook's call center/intake
        application for automating follow-ups from first contacts and referrals.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also turned Tasks into a stand-alone feature, allowing social workers
        to create one-off tasks on their cases and client records outside of
        pre-determined workflows. This enables our users to track all of their
        to-do list items in one place.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img alt="" srcset="./images/workflows/intake-tasks.png" />
        <figcaption>Stand-alone tasks in a Casebook intake</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <p>
        The Workflows feature was shipped in October 2020, and added significant
        business value to Casebook. More than two dozen deals that were pending
        in the fall of 2020 were successfully closed because of the release of
        workflows, and since then about 10,000 workflows are run every year by
        Casebook users.
      </p>
      <p>
        Workflows have been a significant subscription upgrade vector for
        Casebook. Customers can configure a certain number of automated
        workflows at each pricing tier; almost 24% of upgrading customers cite
        the ability to automate more of their processes as a contributing factor
        in their subscription upgrade.
