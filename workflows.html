            Building an automation engine for social work
          </h1>
          <p>
            Social workers usually have too many cases and not enough time; but
            they also have rigid documentation requirements, which means they
            spend hours of their own time after work getting caught up on
            paperwork and manually tracking their clients' progress. This can
            lead to burn-out (as an industry, social workers have a very high
            turnover rate) and mistakes. In social work, a client's life is
            literally on the line, and one paperwork mistake made by a tired,
            overworked social worker can have serious negative consequences.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Casebook, a startup that makes integrated case management
            software for social workers, my team identified a significant
            opportunity to improve the workflow of social workers by building an
            automation engine in Casebook that reduces complexity and repetitive
            work, and increases procedural consistency.
          </p>
          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p>
            Over the summer of 2020, the lead product manager and I conducted
            several interviews with users and joined new customer onboarding
            calls to learn about our users' repeatable processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            All the folks we spoke with could clearly describe at least 3-5
            high-level processes that are well-defined within their practice and
            common to most of their cases.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>most of these processes are tracked on paper, if at all</li>
            <li>
              almost all of these processes may need to be ended early or
              abandoned
            </li>
            <li>
              Some steps in these processes are required, some are optional
            </li>
            <li>
              there are always exceptions! sometimes a supervisor needs to be
              able to skip required parts of a process or add in new ones
            </li>
            <li>
              some processes (and some steps within those processes) have hard
              deadlines that need to be tracked
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The vast number of steps, possible changes, contingencies and the
            need to document it all leads to inconsistencies, errors, and social
            worker burnout. Our customers needed a way to keep track of all of
            this in a systematic way.
          </p>
          <h2>Making complex things simple</h2>
          <p>
            The feature we built in response to this need allowed admin users to
            model real-world repeatable processes in Casebook with task lists
            and create event-based triggers to automatically initiate them.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, an administrator at an agency that helps unhoused
            minors could create a "safe living situation" checklist that starts
            automatically for every new client, or an "independent living
            transition" workflow for kids who age out of the system, which would
            start automatically based on the client's age.
          </p>
          <p>
            This enables social workers to centralize their work. Each case or
            client record has a list of all the actions that need to be taken
            next, and the social worker can see the list of all their tasks
            across cases on their home dashboard. What was previously a stack of
            paper files, several different spreadsheets, and sometimes post-it
            notes on a social worker's desk is now a clear set of digitized,
            prioritized tasks.
          </p>
          <h2>Reducing repetitive work</h2>
          <p>
            To reduce repetitive documentation work, I designed tasks in
            Casebook to be action-oriented. Tasks that require filling out forms
            or uploading files automatically mark themselves complete when those
            actions are taken. This means social workers do not need to spend
            extra time documenting that they completed a paper form or received
            a document from a client; the task marks itself complete when the
            social worker enters that data into Casebook.
          </p>
          <h2>Increasing consistency and accuracy</h2>
          <p>
            As the social worker no longer needs to remember which steps to take
            on each case, they are prompted to complete the same steps for the
            same situation each time it arises. This leads to a higher standard
            of care for clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            Centrally administered settings for automation flows also means that
            changes in an organization's processes can be implemented right
            away, without relying on social workers to remember new steps or
            changes to existing steps.
          </p>
          <p>
            Adding automated workflows to Casebook also increased transparency
            for supervisors. Instead of waiting for a check-in meeting or asking
            the social worker to set aside time to write up a progress report,
            supervisors can see the current state of all of their workers' cases
            in real time.
          </p>
          <h2>Adding business value</h2>
          <p>
            The Workflows feature was shipped in October 2020, and added
            significant business value to Casebook. More than two dozen deals
            that were pending in the fall of 2020 were successfully closed
            because of the release of workflows, and since then about 10,000
            workflows are run every year by Casebook users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Workflows have been a significant subscription upgrade vector for
            Casebook. Customers can configure a certain number of automated
            workflows at each pricing tier; almost 24% of upgrading customers
            cite the ability to automate more of their processes as a
            contributing factor in their subscription upgrade.
          </p>
          <h2>Growing the feature</h2>
          <p>
            Automated workflows were initially added to case management in
            Casebook, but have since been extended to Casebook's call
            center/intake application for automating follow-ups from first
            contacts and referrals.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also turned Tasks into a stand-alone feature, allowing social
            workers to create one-off tasks on their cases and client records
            outside of pre-determined workflows. This enables our users to track
            all of their to-do list items in one place.
